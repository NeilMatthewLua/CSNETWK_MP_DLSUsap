Built and Compiled with Java 8 (with pre-built support for FXML)

1. Compile all the java files. 
2. Run the server using "java Server". Port number can be specified when running but by default it will listen on port 4000. 
Ex. Running a server on port 5000 "java Server 5000". 
3. Clients can be initialized by running "java Main". 
4. In the client GUI, just place the IP address and port number of the server to begin the connection. 


Closing the server
1. When one client disconnects. The server will prompt the user if they want to close the server (Y/N). 
If the server prompt is not answered, it will continue to wait for a response. Meanwhile, server operations will continue as is. It will prompt once more if another logout is made.
2. When "Y" is typed, it will prompt the user if they want to save the server logs. It will include logs leading up to when 
"Y" was typed for closing the server.
