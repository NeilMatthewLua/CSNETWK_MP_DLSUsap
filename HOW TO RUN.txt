Built and Compiled with Java 8

1. Compile all the java files. 
2. Run the server using "java Server". Port number can be specified when running but by default it will listen on port 4000. 
Ex. Running a server on port 5000 "java Server 5000". 
3. Clients can be initialized by running "java Main". 
4. In the client GUI, just place the IP address and port number of the server to begin the connection. 


Closing the server
1. When one client disconnects. The server will prompt the user if they want to close the server (Y/N). 
If the server prompt is not answered, it will continue to wait for a response. Meanwhile, server operations will continue as is. 
2. When "Y" is typed, it will prompt the user if they want to save the server logs. It will include logs leading up to when 
"Y" was typed for closing the server. 
Note: The server will not print another prompt to close the server if an existing prompt has not been resolved. 
Should the user not answer the initial prompt, before he/she can save the logs, he/she must input a 'Y' first later on to account for the initial prompt made. 
Only then will the user be asked to save logs (another 'Y' input)
